						<h2>Program</h2>
						<p>The Department of Math and Computer Studies offers the following degrees:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>B.A. in Computer Science : Our computer science curriculum focuses on modern web and mobile development.  We teach core computer science concepts by using the Python and JavaScript programming languages as our primary tools.  As you work toward completing the requirements for the degree in computer science, you will be exposed to HTML5 and the Node.js runtime environment and popular web frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap and JQuery.  You will also gain valuable industry experience through collaborative course projects and the required internship.  Upon graduating, you will have the skills necessary to create your own web applications and experience with web technologies that are used heavily by companies of all sizes. <a href = "#" class = "show-degree-reqs-link" id = "csc-show-degree-reqs-link">Show Degree Requirements</a></li>

							<p><span class = "featured">Featured course problem (Can you beat the odds?)</span>: The probability of the ball landing on black after a standard American Roulette wheel is spun is 18/38 = 9/19 &approx; 47.37%.  You start with 400 Molloy points.  You win 100 points if the ball lands on black and lose 100 if it lands on red or green.  If you play until you have 500 (net gain of 100) or lose all 400 points, how likely are you to win those points?</p>
							<p>We can write a program to approximate this probability by simulating wheel spins for 100,000 attempts.  How likely are you to go up by 100 points?  The answer may surprise you, but be careful with this strategy because when you lose, you lose all of your points!</p>
